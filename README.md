# Car Model Analysis
Car Model Analysis which analyzes car models for customers in car showroom and motor show.
This program will provide the users with insight into private fuel cars to compare the capabilities.
Users can create graphs in this program to find out the distribution of each attribute for each car model.

# Main features
- Has a default graph when the program starts.
- Allow users to select categories before submitting.
- After submitting categories, display graphs according to selections.
- To submit categories and display graphs or statistics, press one of seven buttons at the bottom of the menu bar.
- Contain a page for storytelling.


# Description
  The program will let users select the categories. After that, the program will present the graph of the selected attribute. One of these is city mpg, highway mpg and stroke for showing correlation (This correlation will show the optimization of the car engine).

  Mainly, this program will let users select the car body, number of doors, fuel type, brand and aspiration to create the graph. This program will let users select attributes to create the graph. First one is the dimensions of the car. Second one is price. Third one is horsepower. Fourth one is mpg scores and km/l scores compared to stroke. Last one is the peak round per minute.
